Rules:
• If multiple bands match, output ONLY the highest band’s score.
• Cite which bullets matched and the exact evidence paths (company, title, dates, description).
• If evidence is weak/implicit, mark it as “inference” and lower confidence.
• Prioritize looking for signals that may indicate "Exceptional Signals: Serial Health Tech Entrepreneur" or "Strong Signals: “Relevant Area” Founder or Serial Founder". Only if the indicators assocated with these bands are conculsively not present, then go on to look for indicators associated with "Moderate Signals: Emerging Founder or Repeat Founding Team Member". If the signals indicating "Moderate Signals: Emerging Founder or Repeat Founding Team Member" are not present, then look for indicators associated with these bands: "Low Signals: Entrepreneurial Exposure and Intent" or "No/Negative Entrepreneurial Signals"

• For any Companies, a person worked at, make sure to conduct a general Google Search as well as look on Crunchbase / Pitchbook etc. for whether teh company was a venture backed company or not.
• Prefer health-tech relevance (operators/founders in care delivery, payor, PBM, digital health, AI/ML in healthcare).
• When evaluating experiences for Founder experience. look for all variations of words such as ["founder","co-founder","cofounder","ceo","cto","entrepreneur in residence","eir","founder in residence","fir"]
• When analyzing if a person has raised a venture round for their current or previous companies, look for words that would indicate that he/she is the Founder (as shared above), as well as look for key words in the decription of their current/previous companies such as: ["seed","pre-seed","series a","series b","series c","series d","raised","funded by","led by","valuation","round","venture","y combinator"] or if the company where the person is a Founder at has details in the metadata   "total_funding_amount" is more than 0, or the "funding_rounds" > 0 or the "investors" within any fundround are mentioned.
  - Make sure that the person is the founder (by applying the logic as shared above) when looking for whether the company they founded has raised a venture round or not.

• When evaluating experiences for early employee patterns look for presence of keywords such as [r"employee\s*#\s*(\d+)", r"first\s+(engineer|hire)", r"early\s+employee", r"founding\s+engineer"] or anything that would be considered contextually similar like "Chief Product Officer", "Chief Growth Officer", "GTM Lead", "AI Lead" etc
• When evaluating experiences for employments at big tech companies, look for presence of keywords such as ["google","alphabet","amazon","meta","facebook","apple","microsoft","netflix","oracle","ibm","salesforce","cisco","uber","lyft","paypal"] as well as companies that are in the same categroy as these companies
